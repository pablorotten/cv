# Presentation of myself

Hello!

My name is Pablo. I'm making this video as cover letter for the DevRel role at Guardsquare. 

> "I spent 10 years as a developer, but I recently had a major realization: I’m a 'Horizontal' thinker in a 'Vertical' world. While my peers loved deep-diving into design patterns and 2-hour meetings about refactoring consistency, I found those discussions exhausting. I realized that while I can write the code, my brain doesn't naturally live in the abstract mathematical architecture—it lives in the application and the outcome."

I spent 10 year as a developer, but I recently had a major realization: I'm not good at it. 

I'm a creative and Lateral thinker in a Vertical world. While my peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, refactoring consistency, discussing requirements for hours and having SCRUM Ceremonies... I found all this exhausting... and honestly, difficult.

> "I noticed a pattern: tasks that made my senior colleagues nervous—like presenting a new feature, writing documentation that actually made sense, or recording a demo—were 'piece of cake' for me. I can visualize how a technical concept should be taught. I have the creative skills to make a video or a schema that makes people get it instantly. I'm choosing to stop forcing myself to be a 'pattern-perfect' developer so I can spend 100% of my energy being a world-class Technical Advocate."

But I noticed a pattern: tasks that made my senior colleagues nervous and insecure, like presenting a new feature, writing documentation that actually made sense, or recording a demo, were "piece of cake" for me. I could instantly visualize what were the key points where I need to focus, what details were important and what were not, and how the material I had to produce have to look like. I can spend 100% of my energy and skills on the creative part of the work, which is what I love, instead of trying to force myself to be a "pattern-perfect" developer.

For example in the UnCrackable challenge video, I spent a considerable amount of time building the tools and doing some convertions to have the right formats of everthing. I quickly realized that it was so boring... it didn't include it in the video. But could be interesting for the most curious viewers; that's why I linked the github repository with detailed explanations. 

Same for the bytecode part... this became quickly a huge rabbit hole. Sure; I could showcase my skills understanding complex bytecode and then the audience would be like "Wow, this guy is a genius!". But the reality is that only a very small percentage of the audience would find this interesting. So instead I leaned towras a more light explanation supported by less technical and more visual representation ussing Cyberchef and using simple methphors representing the decryption process as a key inserted in a lock to open a chest and get a treasure.

> "I’m not the guy who learns a new framework in 5 minutes. It takes me time. But that is exactly why my documentation is so good. Because I have to fight to understand the complexity, I know exactly where other developers are going to get stuck. I document my own struggle, and that results in tutorials that are far more effective than the ones written by 'genius' devs who find everything easy."


> "I love technology—I just love the discovery phase more than the maintenance phase. When I took on your UnCrackable challenge, I wasn't thinking about 'clean code patterns'; I was thinking about the thrill of the bypass and how to show someone else how to do it. That is the energy I want to bring to Guardsquare."

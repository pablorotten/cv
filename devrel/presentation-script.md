# Presentation of myself

Hello!

My name is Pablo. I'm making this video as cover letter for the DevRel role at Guardsquare. 

I spent 10 years as a developer, but I recently had a major realization: I’m just not built for it.

I am a creative, lateral thinker in a vertical world. While my peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, debating refactoring consistency, and sitting through hours of Scrum ceremonies... I found all of that exhausting—and honestly, a struggle.

But I noticed a pattern: tasks that made my senior colleagues nervous, like presenting a new feature, writing documentation that actually made sense, or recording a demo, were a piece of cake for me. I could instantly pick out the key points to focus on, separate the signal from the noise, and visualize exactly how the final material should look. I’ve decided to stop forcing myself to be a "pattern-perfect" developer so I can pour 100% of my energy into the creative advocacy work that I actually love.

For example, while making the UnCrackable challenge video, I spent a lot of time building tools and converting formats just to get everything working. I quickly realized that those parts were incredibly dry, so I cut them from the video. However, I knew they might be useful for the more curious viewers, so I made sure to link the GitHub repository with detailed explanations for anyone who wants to dig deeper.

The same goes for the bytecode section—it’s easy to fall down a rabbit hole there. I could have tried to show off by explaining complex bytecode just to make the audience think, "Wow, this guy is a genius!" But the reality is, most people would have tuned out. Instead, I leaned toward a lighter explanation, using CyberChef and simple metaphors—like a key in a lock opening a treasure chest—to make the decryption process click for everyone.

If you ask me for a list of ten new obfuscation techniques to improve DexGuard, my mind might go blank—I’d probably have to ask an AI for a starting point. But if you give me a new feature and ask me to understand it, document it, and build an engaging demo to promote it? My brain lights up. I’ll have more ideas than I know what to do with, and I won't be able to stop thinking about it until it’s finished."

I’m not the guy who picks up a new framework in five minutes. It takes me time. But that is exactly why my documentation is so effective. Because I have to fight to wrap my head around the complexity, I know exactly where other developers are going to hit a wall. I document my own struggle. I can empathize with a rookie starting from scratch because I know where the friction is, and I know how to smooth it over for them.

I love technology, but I definitely love the discovery phase more than the maintenance phase. When I learn about a new tool, my brain goes into overdrive: What can I build with this? How would I explain it? What fun project can I create to showcase its potential?

When I took on the UnCrackable Challenge for my application video, I wasn't obsessing over 'clean code patterns' or getting bogged down in every tiny detail. Instead, I was geeking out over actually hacking an Android app and solving a real-world puzzle.

We often think of hacking as something magical or impossibly complex, but I was surprised by how simple it can be once you strip away the jargon. I wanted to demystify that process for the audience. My focus was to prove that even the most intimidating tech can be understood by anyone.

In addition on that, I was trying to imagine how Guardsquare’s tools could protect an app from being hacked, how the bytecode would looks like after using DexGuard, and what types of flaws would Appsweep detect. Indeed that was the initial idea but too bad those tools are paid.

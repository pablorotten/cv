# Cover letter script

## Draft version

I spent 10 years as a developer, but I recently had a major realization: I’m just not built for it.

I am a creative, lateral thinker in a vertical world. While my peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, debating refactoring consistency, and sitting through hours of Scrum ceremonies... I found all of that exhausting—and honestly, a struggle.

The truth is, I didn't leave my last role by choice—I was fired. For a moment, it felt like a failure, but it quickly became clear that it was a moment of destiny. It forced me to stop lying to myself. I had been trying to force myself to be a 'pattern-perfect' developer for years, but the universe finally told me to stop.

I noticed a pattern: tasks that made my senior colleagues nervous, like presenting a new feature, writing documentation that actually made sense, or recording a demo, were a piece of cake for me. I could instantly pick out the key points to focus on, separate the signal from the noise, and visualize exactly how the final material should look. Being let go was the push I needed to stop fighting my nature and start pouring 100% of my energy into the creative advocacy work that I actually love.

I’m not the guy who picks up a new framework in five minutes. It takes me time. But that is exactly why my documentation is so effective. Because I have to fight to wrap my head around the complexity, I know exactly where other developers are going to hit a wall. I document my own struggle. I can empathize with a rookie starting from scratch because I know where the friction is, and I know how to smooth it over for them.

I love technology, but I definitely love the discovery phase more than the maintenance phase. When I learn about a new tool, my brain goes into overdrive: What can I build with this? How would I explain it? What fun project can I create to showcase its potential?

For example, when I took on the UnCrackable Challenge for my application video, I wasn't obsessing over 'clean code patterns' or getting bogged down in every tiny detail. Instead, I was geeking out over hacking an Android app and solving a real-world puzzle. I wanted to demystify that process. We often think of hacking as something magical, but I was surprised by how simple it can be once you strip away the jargon.

While making that video, I was already imagining how Guardsquare’s tools would protect that same app—how the bytecode would look after using DexGuard, or what flaws AppSweep would detect. I would have loved to showcase that comparison, but as those are professional tools, I focused on the 'attacker' perspective to prove that even the most intimidating tech can be understood by anyone.

If you ask me for a list of ten new obfuscation techniques to improve DexGuard, my mind might go blank. But if you give me a new feature and ask me to understand it, document it, and build an engaging demo to promote it? My brain lights up. I’ll have more ideas than I know what to do with, and I won't be able to stop thinking about it until it’s finished.

### My Story

- Hello!

- My name is Pablo. And this is my cover letter for the devrel role at Guardsquare.
  
- I spent 10 years as a software developer. 8 of them here in Leuven.
- I always worked in challenging environments: simulation based engineering or optimizing business processes in different industries.
- And for solving complex problems we need to build complex software
- While my super smart peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, code refactorings, hours of Scrum ceremonies... I found all of that exhausting—and honestly, a struggle.
- At some point I start feeling frustrated, I was not growing as software engineer. My brain was not wired for that. 

### DevRel? What is that?

- But I noticed a pattern: 
- There were some tasks that my senior colleagues didn't like, suddently they felt uncomfortable with them...
- ... like presenting or explaining a new feature to the consultant department or clients...
- ... writing and mantaining documentation...
- ... or just designing a demo and recording a video
- And this kind of stuff... were a piece of cake for me. It felt natural and actually I enjoy it
- I could pick out the key points to focus on, separate the signal from the noise, and visualize exactly how the final material should look.

- I started realizing that I had to stop forcing myself to be a "perfect" software engineer, and start embracing my true passion:
- create engaging, educational content
- So one day I decided to dive in some forums, social media and even ask to the AI. What can I do with my career? 
- I didn't want to continue my path as a software engineer, but I didn't want to trash all my experience and... why not? one of my passions.
- And this is how I found the DevRel role. There weren't many offers but for my was super clear thiis was the perfect fit for me. 

- So I started thinking about how to start my career as a DevRel.
- I started volunteering in my company to create documentation, record demos... everything that could be devrel related. 
- I mean, I was already doing that, now I just became CRAZY about it. 
- But I never dared to take the step and apply for the role
- Then something happenede

- ...
- I GOT FIRED 🔥
- But that was a gift
- They forced me to take the plunge and apply for the role
- and gave me plenty of time to prepare myself
- So here I am, applying for a DevRel role for my 1st time in my life
- with 0 experience 😅
- ...

- Why me then?
- Here's why:

### 1. Documenting

- As I said before, I was struggling as a software engineer... but I managed to survive for 10 years in the industry. 
- How?
- DOCUMENTING MY OWN STRUGGLE
- I know exactly where other developers are going to hit a wall. 
- I can empathize with a rookie starting from scratch
- And I know the details an experienced user is looking for
- I know where the friction is...
- ...I know how to smooth it over for them.

### 2. Demos

- You can spend months developing an awesome feature, a feature that is genuinely good. No discussion about that. 
- But if you don't know how to present it... youre fucked up.
- Once I understand the true value and potential of a feature
- I can visualize how to present it
- Explain the problem...
- ... find real world examples everyone can relate to...
- ... use metaphors is is too technical...
- ... generate the tension...
- ... and boom! I can create an engaging outcome to impress everyone
- Give me a tool, a feature, a product to showcase... my brain lights up same as a senior developer solving a recursive problem from advent of code.


### 3. Uncrackable Challenge

- That's what I tried to show in my Uncrackable Challenge video I made (that I hope you watched already)
- I took the product to promote: proguard-assembler and jbc files
- I took a real world problem: reverse engineering an android app
- And then I tried to make an engaging video to show how to solve it

### Conclusion
- I know I have a lot to learn about the main DevRel skills
- But I'm totally confident that I can master them in no time
- The hard part, the technical part, after more than 10 years in the industry, I know I can handle it
- So I would be more than happy to have the opportunity to learn and grow as a DevRel in Guardsquare, and I promise you won't regret it.

## Complex version

I spent 10 years as a developer, but I recently had a major realization: I’m just not built for it.

I am a creative, lateral thinker in a vertical world. While my peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, debating refactoring consistency, and sitting through hours of Scrum ceremonies... I found all of that exhausting—and honestly, a struggle.

But I noticed a pattern: tasks that made my senior colleagues nervous, like presenting a new feature, writing documentation that actually made sense, or recording a demo, were a piece of cake for me. I could instantly pick out the key points to focus on, separate the signal from the noise, and visualize exactly how the final material should look. I’ve decided to stop forcing myself to be a 'pattern-perfect' developer so I can pour 100% of my energy into the creative advocacy work that I actually love.

I’m not the guy who picks up a new framework in five minutes. It takes me time. But that is exactly why my documentation is so effective. Because I have to fight to wrap my head around the complexity, I know exactly where other developers are going to hit a wall. I document my own struggle. I can empathize with a rookie starting from scratch because I know where the friction is, and I know how to smooth it over for them.

I love technology, but I definitely love the discovery phase more than the maintenance phase. When I learn about a new tool, my brain goes into overdrive: What can I build with this? How would I explain it? What fun project can I create to showcase its potential?

For example, when I took on the UnCrackable Challenge for my application video, I wasn't obsessing over 'clean code patterns' or getting bogged down in every tiny detail. Instead, I was geeking out over hacking an Android app and solving a real-world puzzle. I wanted to demystify that process. We often think of hacking as something magical, but I was surprised by how simple it can be once you strip away the jargon.

While making that video, I was already imagining how Guardsquare’s tools would protect that same app—how the bytecode would look after using DexGuard, or what flaws AppSweep would detect. I would have loved to showcase that comparison, but as those are professional tools, I focused on the 'attacker' perspective to prove that even the most intimidating tech can be understood by anyone.

If you ask me for a list of new obfuscation techniques to improve DexGuard, my mind might go blank. But if you give me a new feature and ask me to understand it, document it, and build an engaging demo to promote it? My brain lights up. I’ll have more ideas than I know what to do with, and I won't be able to stop thinking about it until it’s finished.

# Presentation of myself

Hello!

My name is Pablo. I'm making this video as cover letter for the DevRel role at Guardsquare. 


I spent 10 years as a developer, but I recently had a major realization: I’m just not built for it.

I am a creative, lateral thinker in a vertical world. While my peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, debating refactoring consistency, and sitting through hours of Scrum ceremonies... I found all of that exhausting—and honestly, a struggle.

But I noticed a pattern: tasks that made my senior colleagues nervous, like presenting a new feature, writing documentation that actually made sense, or recording a demo, were a piece of cake for me. I could instantly pick out the key points to focus on, separate the signal from the noise, and visualize exactly how the final material should look. I’ve decided to stop forcing myself to be a "pattern-perfect" developer so I can pour 100% of my energy into the creative advocacy work that I actually love.


For example, while making the UnCrackable challenge video, I spent a lot of time building tools and converting formats just to get everything working. I quickly realized that those parts were incredibly dry, so I cut them from the video. However, I knew they might be useful for the more curious viewers, so I made sure to link the GitHub repository with detailed explanations for anyone who wants to dig deeper.

The same goes for the bytecode section—it’s easy to fall down a rabbit hole there. I could have tried to show off by explaining complex bytecode just to make the audience think, "Wow, this guy is a genius!" But the reality is, most people would have tuned out. Instead, I leaned toward a lighter explanation, using CyberChef and simple metaphors—like a key in a lock opening a treasure chest—to make the decryption process click for everyone.

I’m not the guy who learns a new framework in 5 minutes. It takes me time. But that is exactly why my documentation is so good. Because I have to fight to understand the complexity, I know exactly where other developers are going to get stuck. I document my own struggle, I can empathize with a  rookie that start out with the matter and I know what are going to be the struggles and how to reduce the friction. All this results in far more effective material.

I love technology—I just love the discovery phase more than the maintenance phase. When I learn about a new technology or tool, it starts a brainstorm in my head about what can I do with this, how it will look like, how can I explain this or that, what small project can I build with it that it will be fun and easy to undestand but also can showcase the potential of the technology. 
When I took on the UnCrackable challenge, I wasn't thinking about 'clean code patterns'; I was thinking about the thrill of the bypass and how to show someone else how to do it. And I couldn't stop thinking about how Guardsquare tools could protect the app to be hacked, how the bytecode would look like and how could I do a comparison and kind of sell the tool. ALl this things comes into my mind. If you ask me to give you ideas to improve a tool like DexGuard, like discovering a new obfuscation technique... I'm not the guy who will give you a list of 10 bullet points. My brain would be totally blank in that case and I would just desesperaly ask the AI. But I'd would be thrilled to understand that new feature, document it, showcase with cool and engaging demos and promote it, my brain will be full of ideas and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

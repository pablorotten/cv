# Cover Video Script: Pablo x Guardsquare

## 1. The 10-Year Realization

* Hello! I’m Pablo, and this is my "cover video" for the DevRel role at Guardsquare.
* I’ve spent a decade as a software dev—eight of those years right here in Leuven.
* While my brilliant peers loved deep-diving into design patterns or long Scrum ceremonies, I found it exhausting.
* I reached a point where I felt stuck because my brain just wasn't wired for "pattern-perfect" engineering.

## 2. The Epiphany

* presenting features, writing docs, or recording demos.
* I realized I could "separate the signal from the noise"—picking exactly what matters to an audience and telling that story.
* creating engaging, educational content.

## 3. The Turning Point

* I discovered DevRel—the perfect bridge between my technical past and my creative future.
* I started volunteering for these tasks internally, but I never quite dared to take the plunge... until destiny stepped in.
* I got fired 🔥.
* That shock was actually a win. It forced me to finally apply for a DevRel role for the first time in my life.

## 4. Why Hire Me?

* I survived 10 years by documenting my own uphill battles. 
* Since I don’t pick up frameworks in five minutes, I know exactly where other devs will hit a wall. I know how to smooth over the friction.
* If you can’t present a great feature, it falls flat. I find the metaphors and build real-world examples that actually impress people.
* Check out my UnCrackable Challenge video. I used your ProGuard tools to reverse-engineer an Android app, making the "how" engaging and accessible.

## 5. Conclusion

* I have a lot to learn about DevRel nuances, but with 10 years of technical foundation, I’ll master the craft in no time. 
* I’m looking for the opportunity to grow into a world-class Advocate at Guardsquare. Give me that shot—you won’t regret it.

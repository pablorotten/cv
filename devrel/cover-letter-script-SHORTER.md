# Cover letter script

## The 10-Year Realization

- Hello!
- My name is Pablo. And this is my "cover letter" for the devrel role at Guardsquare.

- I’ve spent a decade as a software developer—eight of those years right here in Leuven.
- I’ve always worked in high-pressure environments, from industrial simulation to complex business process optimization...
- ... and solving "big" problems requires complex software.
- while my brilliant peers loved deep-diving into design patterns, debating refactoring consistency, or sitting through hours of Scrum ceremonies... I found all of that exhausting, sometimes a struggle.
- I reached a point where I felt stuck...
- ... I wasn't growing as an engineer because, frankly, my brain just wasn't wired for that.

## DevRel? What is that?

- Then, I spotted a pattern: 
- There were tasks my senior colleagues avoided—tasks that made them visibly uncomfortable:
- presenting a new feature to consultants...
- ... solving problems to clients... 
- ... maintaining documentation....
- ... or designing and recording a demo
- I realized I could "separate the signal from the noise"
- Picking out exactly what mattered to the audience and visualizing how to tell that story.
- I could stop forcing myself to be a "pattern-perfect" engineer and start embracing my true passion: creating engaging, educational content.

## The Turning Point

- I started diving into forums and asking the community (and even AI): 
- "How do I pivot without trashing ten years of experience?"
- That’s when I discovered DevRel. 
- I could link my technical past to my creative future.

- I started volunteering for "DevRel" tasks within my own company
- becoming obsessed with documentation, presentations and demos
- But I never quite dared to take the leap and apply for a real role... until destiny stepped in.

- ...
- I GOT FIRED 🔥
- First, a shock
- But quickly, a win
- It forced me to take the plunge and apply for the role
- So here I am, applying for a DevRel role for my 1st time in my life
- with 0 experience 😅
- ...

## Why hire me?

- Why me then?
- Here's why:

## 1. Documenting the Struggle

- As I mentioned before,I survived 10 years in the industry. 
- How?
- DOCUMENTING MY OWN UPHILL BATTLES
- Because I don't pick up frameworks in five minutes
- I know exactly where other developers are going to hit a wall. 
- I can empathize with a rookie starting from scratch
- But I also know the high-level details an experienced user is hunting for
- I know where the friction is...
- ...I know how to smooth it over.

## 2. Turn Features into Stories

- You can spend months developing an awesome feature, a feature that is genuinely good, perfect, No discussion
- but if you can’t present it, it falls flat.
- Once I see the potential in a tool, my brain goes into overdrive. 
- I find the metaphors
- I build the real-world examples
- I generate the tension,
- and—boom—I create an outcome that actually impresses people.
- And all this,I can visualize it from the very beginning 

## 3. The UnCrackable Proof

- That’s exactly what I tried to showcase in my UnCrackable Challenge video (that I hope you watched already). I'll leave the link here, just in case...
- I took your tools —the ProGuard Assembler and JBC files—...
- ...and applied them to a real-world problem: reverse-engineering an Android app.
- I didn't just show the "how"; I tried to make it engaging and accessible.
  
## Conclusion
- I know I have a lot to learn about the nuances of Developer Relations,
- But I am 100% confident I can master the craft in no time.
- The technical foundation is there—ten years of it.
- I’m looking for the opportunity to grow into a world-class Advocate at Guardsquare, and I promise you won’t regret giving me that shot.

# Cover letter script

## The 10-Year Realization

- Hello!
- My name is Pablo. And this is my "cover letter" for the devrel role at Guardsquare.
- I’ve spent a decade as a software developer—eight of those years right here in Leuven.
- Deep-diving into design patterns,  tryiging to produce high quality code, long Scrum ceremonies.... Honestly, I found it exhausting.
- I reached a point where I felt stuck because my brain just wasn't wired for "pattern-perfect" engineering.

## DevRel? What is that?

- presenting features, writing docs, or recording demos.
- I realized I could "separate the signal from the noise"—picking exactly what matters to an audience and telling that story.
- creating engaging, educational content... I was good at it, I enjoyed it. 
- For once, I found something were I could beat my smart peers.

## The Turning Point

- I discovered DevRel—the perfect bridge between my technical past and my creative future.
- I started volunteering for "DevRel" tasks within my own company: documentation, presentations and demos
- But I never quite dared to take the plunge... until destiny stepped in.

- ...
- I GOT FIRED 🔥
- First, a shock
- But actualy, a win
- It forced me to apply to the role
- So here I am, applying for a DevRel role for my 1st time in my life
- with 0 experience 😅
- ...

## Why hire me?

- Why me then?
- I survived 10 years by documenting my own uphill battles. 
- When I learn about a new product, tool or feature
- I know where the friction is...
- ...I know how to smooth it over.
- But I also know the high-level details an experienced user is hunting for

## 2. Turn Features into Stories: The UnCrackable Proof

- You can spend months developing an awesome feature, a feature that is genuinely good, perfect, No discussion
- but if you can’t present it, it falls flat.
- That’s exactly what I tried to showcase in my UnCrackable Challenge video (that I hope you watched already). I'll leave the link here, just in case...
- I used your ProGuard tools to reverse-engineer an Android app, making the "how" engaging and accessible.
- So anyone can see the potential 
 
## Conclusion
* I have a lot to learn about DevRel nuances, but with 10 years of technical foundation, I’ll master the craft in no time. 
* I’m looking for the opportunity to grow into a world-class Advocate at Guardsquare. Give me that shot—you won’t regret it.
